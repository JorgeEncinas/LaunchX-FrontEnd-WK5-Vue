# bakery

This is a bakery website (as seen in WK2-HTML), using the Vue framework. It's incomplete, since I have not fixed the "id", so that it is added to every order automatically on creation, but I'm running out of time and got other things to get to, so I'm getting this far, and once the course is over, I can come back to the project and finish that little quirk.
